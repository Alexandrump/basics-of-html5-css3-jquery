Inheritance on Java using Gradle
--------------------------------
### Dependencies
- [nodeJs](https://nodejs.org/es/download/package-manager/) instructions inside previous link


### How to run

- Go to download folder and type in Terminal:  `cd BrujulaIT/basics-of-html5-css3-jquery` 

- Run `npm install && npm run start` or first `npm install `, and then ` npm run start`

### What's the next (to improve)

- Introduce DockerFile to run from a container.

### What about the code

Source files are inside *BrujulaIT/basics-of-html5-css3-jquery/public* folder.

The project have been done using NodeJs with ExpressJs for agile development, jQuery on client side, Bootstrap 4, and WebStorm IDE.

The exercise was easy so I have introduced SCSS compiler to write the custom CSS clases .

In JS there are two files, one of this is a service where I've simulated the Namespace approach of JS language.
